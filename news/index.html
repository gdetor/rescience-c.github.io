    <h2>Sustainable computational science: the ReScience initiative</h2>
    <span class="post-meta">Dec 18, 2017</span>
    <p>We just published our white paper on ReScience in
<a href="https://peerj.com/articles/cs-142/">PeerJ</a></p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Computer science offers a large set of tools for
prototyping, writing, running, testing, validating, sharing and reproducing
results; however, computational science lags behind. In the best case, authors
may provide their source code as a compressed archive and they may feel
confident their research is reproducible. But this is not exactly true. James
Buckheit and David Donoho proposed more than two decades ago that an article
about computational results is advertising, not scholarship. The actual
scholarship is the full software environment, code, and data that produced the
result. This implies new workflows, in particular in peer-reviews. Existing
journals have been slow to adapt: source codes are rarely requested and are
hardly ever actually executed to check that they produce the results advertised
in the article. ReScience is a peer-reviewed journal that targets computational
research and encourages the explicit replication of already published research,
promoting new and open-source implementations in order to ensure that the
original research can be replicated from its description. To achieve this goal,
the whole publishing chain is radically different from other traditional
scientific journals. ReScience resides on GitHub where each new implementation
of a computational study is made available together with comments,
explanations, and software tests.</p>

    <h2>Call for replication</h2>
    <span class="post-meta">Oct 19, 2016</span>
    <p>It is now possible to suggest an article for a replication. Just
<a href="https://github.com/ReScience/call-for-replication/issues/new">open a new issue</a> 
in the
<a href="https://github.com/ReScience/call-for-replication">call for replication repository</a>
and give the reference of the original article and possibly the reason you
would like to see this article replicated (please refrain from suggesting your
own work). Note that you’re also encouraged to register as a reviewer such that
you can review the replication you’ve been proposing if someone actually takes
up the challenge.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for some challenge, you can also look at the
<a href="https://github.com/ReScience/call-for-replication/issues">current list of suggestions</a>.</p>

    <h2>You can help by becoming a reviewer</h2>
    <span class="post-meta">Jul 2, 2016</span>
    <p>ReScience is slowly gaining momentum and we currently have 4 submissions to
review. If you’re interested in helping ReScience and reproducibility, you can
become a reviewer. What you need is a github account, a one line description of
your expertise (see the <a href="http://rescience.github.io/board/">Board</a> for some
examples) and to <a href="https://github.com/ReScience/ReScience/issues/27">tell us</a> you’re interested such that we can add you to the board. You can also <a href="https://github.com/ReScience/ReScience-submission/subscription">follow</a> the <a href="https://github.com/ReScience/ReScience-submission">submission</a> repository and propose your help whenever a submission falls into your expertise domain.</p>
